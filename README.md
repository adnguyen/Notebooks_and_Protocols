This repo shares my protocols and notebooks of ongoing work with the aim of capturing the process of science as it is happening and making it transparent and reproducible. Template for making an online notebook found [here](https://github.com/adnguyen/Notebooks_and_Protocols/blob/master/Online_notebook_template.md).
