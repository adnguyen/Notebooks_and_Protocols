### Page 1: 2018-12-4. Creating this Repository

This repository was first forked from Andrew Nguyen's Notebook Repository [here](https://github.com/adnguyen/Notebooks_and_Protocols)
Then following previous instructions for making someone else's repository your own from my other lab notebook, also on GitHub [here](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Forked-Repository-And-Site-Instructions/) this notebook was created

The README file was editied and things were hopefully formatted correctly! I will come back tomorrow to add what supplies we are ordering for this project
